to do:

-make enemy ship hazards
	-normal hazards will just be the squares with numbers not divisible by 3 or 5
	-overlay text ui on ships that display random divisions of 3 and 5 from 1-100
	-for divisions of 3 & 5 make their score value 3 & 5 respectively (like with the current hazards)
	-for divisions of 15 make their score value 15 (like with current hazards)
	-ship hazards will also fire bullets forward at an interval that the player has to avoid
	-add some sort of fizzy, buzzy and fizzbuzzy animation and/or sounds to indicate different point values

-make end credits
